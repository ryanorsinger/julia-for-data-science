# Julia for Data Science 

## Outline
This repository contains my work for updating code samples from [Julia for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Julia-Data-Science-Zacharias-Voulgaris-ebook/dp/B01KAY4WUY) by Zacharias Voulgaris to Julia version 1.1.1.

## Rationale
- After reading "Data Science: Mindset, Methodologies, and Misconceptions", I found myself getting solid value from Voulgaris's work and approach. In a video course on SafariOnline, the author suggested that working the examples in the latest Julia would be a high value exercise.
- My short answer to "Why Julia" is power, economy, and elegance along with language syntax that plays *very* nicely with mathematical notation. It looks like a language worth my time exploring.
- My long answer to "Why Julia?" is best summed up by how short/sweet the assembly code is at the 20 minute mark in [this video by Alan Edelman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZS2LGiurKY)

## Organization
- The `code` folder contains programs/scripts by chapter to update code to Julia version 1.1.1
- The `changelog` folder contains changes/edits/updates by chapter to bring the examples up to date.
- The `notes` folder contains my own notes.
- Datasets are contained in `data`. If a specific dataset is too large to commit to GitHub, then the original source will be linked in the code.
